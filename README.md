# Reproducing Dynamic Rereference Interval Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the top policy generated by an LLM for last level cache replacement policy.
Several ablations were tested, with the top result coming from regular iterations over opanai's o4-mini.


## Replicating the Experiment

### Running the replication script 

In order to fully replicate results, run this in the execution git root directory:
```shell
./reprouce.sh
```
This shell script does many functions
1. **Install packages**: this will install all needed pip packages used 
   and ensure that all of the correct versions are installed.

2. **Run replacement policy script**: the replacement policy will be ran
   on the ChampSim framework. The results will be printed out to terminal

### Expected package versions

- gcc-15 or clang-19
- CMake 3.27
- Even when using clang, the only standard library supported is libstdc++;
  libc++ may work but it is not a tested platform

### CPU compilation requirements
